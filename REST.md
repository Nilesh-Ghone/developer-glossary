Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the internet. 

RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.). By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, RESTful systems aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow by reusing components.

Note -  REST is an architectural style. There is no "official" standard for RESTful web APIs, REST is not a standard in itself, but RESTful implementations make use of standards, such as HTTP, URI, JSON, and XML.
